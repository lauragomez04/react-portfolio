      "Presagio App is a responsive weather web app I built from scratch in React to learn how to use this library. I used the OpenWeatherMap API to display the daily forecast for five days for a specific location. Illustrations change according to the weather condition results.",

      "The purpose of this project was to learn how to use React after building the first iteration of this app with vanilla Javascript during the SheCodes workshops. From the beginning, I wanted this app to be visually pleasing for the user, so I started this process by sketching a wireframe in inVision and designing the mockup in Adobe Illustrator. Illustrations by storyset were adapted to this design.",
    stack:
      "I wanted to learn React and its main functionalities, so developing the second iteration of this app using this library was perfect. I used Bootstrap to make the Presagio app responsive, use the icons library and improve my skills in this framework. I hosted this app in Netlify because I'm familiar with it; it has a simple workflow and makes it easy to deploy React apps. Oh, and it's free!",

      "Dictionary App is a responsive web app I build from scratch to strengthen my skills in React and practice fetching data from APIs with Axios. I used the Google Dictionary and the Pexels APIs to display meanings and images. I also used a custom hook (use-sound) to be able to play the word phonetics.",

      "I used React to continue improving my skills in this library,  its simplicity, and the possibility of using libraries built by other developers. In this project, I used use-sound by Josh Comeau to play the word phonetics mp3 file from the Google Dictionary API. I used Bootstrap to make this app responsive in all devices and for the icons I needed.",
