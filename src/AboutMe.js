            I'm Laura, a front-end developer with experience in product design
            and digital marketing. I'm here to help you bring ideas to life by
            building responsive user interfaces. I live to make things, and I'm
            only happy when they are beautiful and functional.
            <br />
            <br />
            My interest in web development began while supporting projects in
            different sectors as a designer and digital marketer. I constantly
            edited and built websites with page builders for WordPress but felt
            limited by these tools and my lack of knowledge in coding.
            <br />
            <br />
            I joined SheCodes Pro workshops to upgrade and combine my skills and
            focus more on product development. I'm captivated by this field,
            where there is always more to learn. Iâ€™m interested in joining a
            team where I can contribute and continue learning.
            <br />
            <br />
            When I'm not coding, I'm exploring hidden corners of Lisbon, looking
            for dolphins along the Tejo River, or embroidering, my other kind of
            coding.
            <br />
            <br />
            Technologies I've been working with are HTML5, CSS3, Javascript,
            React, and Bootstrap.
